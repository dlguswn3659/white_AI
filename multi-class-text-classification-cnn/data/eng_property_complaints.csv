Regarding the application of the 3rd Lease Act.,"Hello, I would like to contact you to find out whether the 3rd Lease Act is applicable. The law does not provide detailed information, so it seems that it is a part that needs to be interpreted, so I would like to inquire like this.<Relationship> A trainee living in an LH installment rental apartment, which was confirmed for early sale in May of this year (author)-About two years ago, LH, tenant The person who will be) and the trainee (author) made a legal sublease contract under the agreement of the LH center, and after that, they made a worldwide agreement with the tenant through real estate, and the deadline is until September this year. <Situation> Early pre-sale in May of this year. As the tenant becomes the landlord in May, the relationship with LH will disappear.- As the sublease contract is terminated in LH, the contract between the tenant and the tenant does not actually apply to the 3rd Lease Act, and is new after May. The current tenant's insistence that a new contract with the landlord should be signed.- The author's argument is that although the tenant-tenant relationship disappears, the right of the contract will not be extinguished if the tenant becomes a tenant. Since the landlord is in May, there is only 4 months left until September, so the author can request a renewal of the contract as it is. This is the situation. I wonder if you can support my claim in this case legally. Thank you in advance.",monthly

"Please help, the renter is a person","I'm a smoker. I lived for a year and a half on a two-year contract. There are a lot of absurd things, but it's too long to talk about it all, so I'll skip it and ask only questions.

But when I'm out of the house, I come and give me money. In the meantime, the owner has been arguing because he has said so absurd, but he is so exhausted that he will do what he asked for, but I think this is not the case. He's a person who can't really do it. This doesn't make sense. It's a really amazing person. It was 10cm long, but I asked for 100,000 won, so I gave it to you. I hate to do what he wants now.

We would like to inquire about whether the conditions for terminating the studio contract are met.,"We would like to inquire about the establishment of the conditions for canceling the one-room contract. 1. A: Landlord 2. E: Tenant Situation 1. Eul asked for <fixed seat parking> through a realtor before the studio contract, and the realtor said that he received a reply to the manager through Kakao Talk saying that <fixed seat parking> was possible. After that, immediately after the contract, Eul-eun asked about <fixed seat parking> at the place where the manager and A were together, and after receiving a verbal reply saying <no problem>, he signed a one-year contract as a final charter. However, the contract does not specify <fixed seat parking> After the contract, I requested <fixed seat parking>, but received a call from the manager asking for <wait for the construction to be completed>. After that, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months.. The construction continues to lengthen, and the lack of parking spaces due to construction materials, and inconvenience due to redundant parking accumulates. I said, ""I will mark the parking"", but ""Please wait until the parking lot is cleared."" Received a response saying, ""You cannot mark the designated parking at your discretion."" (There is a text record) Inquiry 1. In the case of situation 1 above, can the contract be terminated (destroyed) for violating the condition of ``fixed seat parking is possible'', which was confirmed verbally with KakaoTalk records shared with the realtor and A (rental) and manager? Only KakaoTalk records shared with real estate agents exist, and the terms and conditions are not specified in the contract, but Eul (the tenant) checked with the real estate agent several times and played a decisive role in the contract. Ap and the manager were notified that they would move one year before the charter contract due to inconvenient parking, negligence of management by the manager (it is a mess because there is no garbage management, there is a photo), and noise damage caused by the lengthened construction period without a contract. There is a record of all the text messages sent and received with the manager.) The manager said that he would release the room immediately, but it has not been posted for sale on real estate and Internet real estate such as Naver until the end of two weeks. Eul asked the manager again <Is it correct that it was for sale?>, but received an answer such as <I uploaded it on their own computer>. Eul, who could not stand it, notified that she would put her house for sale through <Jikbang>, and registered directly with <Jikbang>. Only then did I get a call from the real estate agent saying that I would come to see the house, but most of them received a text message such as <I can't see the house because the landlord couldn't contact me>. Eul directly called Gap twice, but the phone could not be connected to Eul. Then I called the manager, but <I am talking to myself well and there is no problem. There were no people coming to see the room because of the corona, but I registered.> (At this point, there are no real estate sites that have been uploaded other than items posted by Eul, such as Naver Real Estate). Can I cancel the contract on the date that I want to move out when I can't get it? The actual proof is the text <I can't contact the renter> from each other real estate agent. There are also transcripts of conversations and text messages we had with the manager. After signing a contract for a new construction, it was very painful... ㅠ Please legally review whether each contract can be terminated.. If possible, I will send a proof of the contents in my name.

Is it difficult for an individual to dispose of the suspension of construction rights infringement?,"Construction is underway 1M in front of the house. Noise, dust, and vibration are causing a lot of damage to life... Ventilation is difficult and noise and vibration make it difficult to sleep properly. I suffer from allergic rhinitis and asthma, but the condition that had improved for a while may worsen again. The number of times I woke up because I couldn't breathe has increased. A 20-story officetel is scheduled to come in, but the number of floors I live in is on the 3rd floor. (The number of floors in the apartment is 11th floor.) The soundproof walls are also extremely low, so the soundproofing is not at all, and the construction vibration is transmitted directly to the building. It was also broken, not to mention the dust. I take allergic rhinitis and asthma medications that are prescribed to take once every 3 days. In the case of my mother who lives with me, I stand on the night watch once every 3 days, but my health was a little bad because I couldn't sleep at all during the day. Since you are a bit old, I am a lot worried that you will fall due to lack of sleep or overwork. The direction of the house is from northeast to southwest, so it is on the side with good sunlight, but after entering the building, it is expected that the sun will not rise at all until late afternoon. .It's a house where both the sun and the wind are good, but once it's built, both the sun and the wind won't go well. If even the windows come in contact, it won't be easy to open the windows. But after that, what... is it bothersome to the ward office?.. Heh.... A total of 3 civil petitions were entered, but after the first there was no change, no construction was stopped, and the noise, vibration, and dust were all the same ^^ At first I also told you the decibel measurement result, and if you want to measure it, I will visit you at the time you want, so I'll call you.. I'm tired of entering civil petitions. However, during that period, I wondered if I would pay for the hospital expenses and medicines, or what money would I compensate for? A. If you proceed as an individual, will it be less likely to win? Would it be better to gather residents even if it takes a little more time and is difficult? Also, it would be very difficult to win without a lawyer. Please save me and my mother, who are dying of construction noise, vibration, and dust.. ㅠㅠ",administration
I'm in a dispute with an unscrupulous tenant.,"It is a situation where a 24 pyeong apartment is chartered. The tenant is in a state that has received the final date for the payment of the balance and the notification of moving in, but the day after the balance day, he suddenly contacted the house and asked for the breach of the contract, saying that he was unsatisfied with the house and the boiler is worn out. We were lucky to have a new tenant, so we even exchanged temporary down payments. But the very next day, in the midst of a commotion saying that my house is better and returning the down payment, we received only the temporary contract money back saying that we knew the new tenant. In the situation, I don't want to bring in this tenant. I haven't moved in yet, but the agreement to cancel the contract is still valid, so I want to ask if it is possible to change the tenant. Since it is a situation that has not moved in yet, the contract has been terminated, so some people ask you to get it quickly, so I am wondering which way to proceed.",contract

I can't stand it, so if I don't return the deposit by tomorrow, I will do it legally.

Commercial real estate provisional contract brokerage fee inquiry,"A. I saw a shopping mall rental building through real estate, but he said that he did not like it. That way, I ended the relationship with Real Estate A and met the building owner who was introduced four times. I liked the building. So I decided to make a contract with the owner (the representative of the project company) to discuss conditions such as deposit and rent. If you sign a contract and sign a contract without brokerage fees, it would be better to express your sincerity to Real Estate A, who introduced you instead. After that, a temporary contract was signed with the building owner for a deposit of 40 million won / monthly rent of 4.5 million won. It's small, but they say they want to show their heart, so they just ask for a legal brokerage fee. So, when I delivered the details to the building owner (Real Estate B), it was not legally necessary to give it, but he told me to talk to the right side to solve it properly (if it was brokered, I would talk about a fee of 4 to 5 million won). Please answer me whether I should pay the brokerage fee to Real Estate A and how to deal with it in this case!",contract

He asked me why this is the case, and said that if I received the transaction amount of 65 million won, I could give it to the real estate manager for 2 million won. Question!!!1. In the above situation, it seems that my parents and the real estate manager have agreed to do that over the phone. The landlord is me, and I know the welfare cost is around 30~40. Is it correct that I have to pay 2 million won?2. Is it legally irrelevant if the seller and the broker do such a transaction without the buyer's knowledge? There is no difference between selling and selling for 6300 by cutting 200 from 6500 and selling for 6500 and giving 200 to the brokerage.",contract
No one who lives in an unlicensed building in the inherited land doesn't go out. Is there any way?,"When my father was alive, he inherited the land as a condition of building a new house on the land. It is a land in the name of the deceased grandfather, so the grandmother and the rest of the brothers agreed to inherit the inheritance, received a seal, and received the inheritance as the eldest son, and built a house with his father's money. I postponed the inheritance of the vacant house, and my eldest aunt lived in the vacant house free of charge for 20 years-My father was also a brother, so he did not receive any money, and until now, he paid the land & housing tax alone. There is a situation where the Rosie itself has been advised to open the house, and the father has vacated the house, and the aunt says that he cannot leave, and if he gives 20 million won to leave, he will leave. In this case, can you legally send out your big aunt? Since it was 20 years ago, there was no receipt for the money when building the house, and because I did not like to get involved in a dispute between siblings, only 1 out of 7 siblings wrote a confirmation of the above fact2.

I am in trouble with the world medicine,"Good morning. This time, I signed a multi-family housing contract with a worldwide drug. I tried to use a bank loan for about half of the deposit.. But because I don't know the real estate well... I wrote a contract without knowing about the senior deposit. I said it would come out, but when I calculated it with the senior deposit, it looked like a very dangerous building. On the other hand, the contract states that if the chartered loan is not issued, the contract will be automatically terminated and the landlord must return the deposit without any conditions. The former tenant heard this and signed a contract for the house to move in. But I said to cancel the contract and return the down payment because the loan was no longer available, but in the real estate this is your fault. What if the previous tenant pays the down payment because you don't have money to give it to you? It is a situation. In fact, if the real estate broker properly notified the senior deposit as written in the law... or as in Article 48 of the Special Act on Private Rental Housing. The date the rental business is granted the senior deposit and the confirmation date. Would this have not occurred in the first place if the status of the fixed date of the lease period of the former tenants was provided in a written form requested by the fixed date granting agency. (Originally, it was x billion, and it was incorrectly marked as 10 times.) There was such a typo, but neither the broker nor the tenant nor the building owner knew it. Is this not evidence that the broker did not accurately explain sincerely ㅠ... Without explaining it at the time, the senior deposit was passed by passing the paper over, and only the other part was this part. (There is no transcript at the time of the contract). ..The building owner is embarrassed because there is no money..In fact, I don't understand that there are only 1~200 million people who only have 4 billion real estate.

Whether or not legal territorial rights are established,"You are trying to bid for an item that is <Land only for sale>. At this point, the land owner and the building owner appear to be the same.

I am curious about the public support private rental housing business.,"I have a question about public support private rental housing, so I ask a question. If I apply for publicly supported private rental housing on my land (approximately 80 pyeong) in the station area (within 350 m), how will it proceed? Public-assisted private rental means I lose ownership because I donate a certain portion of the number of households built in my building? 8 years? 10 years? When the rental period is over, how is the ownership of 10 households handled? First of all, it was difficult to find related information such as private rental housing....",Trading

I would like to ask about the cancellation of the contract before the construction of the housing union apartment.,"Hello My mom wants to get a sale of an apartment housed by the housing association, so she looked around the model house at the housing public relations office, wrote a contract and memorandum, and made a deposit of 5 million won. Dad, younger brother, and I, excluding mom, will do well on their own. When I signed the contract, my mom told me that when I signed the contract, the chief of staff couldn't see it properly, and I didn't read the documents properly, but I hurried to sign the box. I was anxious and anxious about it, so I checked it on the Internet and found that it was a business with a considerable risk in the case of a housing cooperative apartment. So, my family persuaded my dad, and my family visited the housing public relations again to request a member withdrawal and a request for a refund of 5 million won for the down payment. But the head of the office and the head of the headquarters? Said, Mom already signed the contract and the handwritten signature on the contract. He said that if he wanted to terminate the contract in the middle, he could not return the money because he signed a memorandum that he could not get back the 5 million won deposit paid. And they explained everything to their mother about their business, and they weren't one or two years old and they were adults, but they didn't understand if they signed the papers. Honestly, the memorandum was also the same, and it seems like they were unconditionally wrong with the mother's signature.. When I asked if I could get a copy of the documents my mom signed, they said I couldn't give it right now. I didn't tell me why and I couldn't understand, but I agreed because I didn't know this field well and I didn't want to stimulate them. And what I'm saying is, if legally, the deposit 500 deposit is money we can't get back. I'll talk to the trust, and I'll tell you when the results come out according to the opinions of the union members, so I'll contact you after the Seol, so I'll come back at that time, and now I'm in the state of returning home by asking me to return. Qualifications to become a union member: It is said that the head of the household is the head of the household, and among them, only those who are homeless or one housed under 85m are allowed. Currently, the mother has two apartments in her name, so the above conditions are not met, so she can sign a contract in the first place. It's a condition that doesn't exist, and the head of the Housing Public Relations Office was already aware of this. No matter how the down payment is made by borrowing, the money going forward can be made by selling the house that the mother currently owns. Even though they know that they are currently in residence, they induce them to join. Still, I wrote a contract in my mother's name, and is it legally valid to write a memorandum like that? Because there is a problem with the contract itself, I think it cannot be legally effective. It's a screaming situation. I feel like there aren't any real robbers.. And it seems that I couldn't make a rational judgment because I had a strong desire to live in a new house about what my mom was possessed by, and I thought it was too easy. I barely persuaded me to cancel the apartment. I asked, but the law changed differently from the past, so the success rate wasn't that low, and I wasn't thinking about the bad side..

I am in a situation where I have lived for more than 30 years after building on the land owned by others. Help. ㅠㅠ,"Question Summary>I have been living for more than 30 years after building on the land owned by others. Help. ㅠㅠ (I'm not sure if I get counseling from a lawyer or a lawyer for such a problem) Summary of Contents> I have built my own house on land owned by others (of the land) for decades, but this year, the Yonsei who was usually paid by the Jongjung side ( I don't know how to deal with it by sending a registered mail (not proof of content) that requires 30 times the amount (10 million won a year) of 300,000 won per year), so I don't know how to deal with it. A father-in-law has been living in another person's land (Jeonju-i's Jongjung Land) in Gwangtan-myeon, Paju-si for nearly 40 years... I lived without any problems for a year, the contract seems to have been written with the representative of Jongjung, usually in ``three years'', and I paid about 300,000 won a year for land use (similar to other neighbors). Currently, houses built on the land are shabby and long-lasting. The contract was signed from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 (three years), but the last contract was 1) 60 pyeong of housing site, 40 pyeong of garden, total According to the content of renting 100 pyeong of land for 300,000 won per year 2) At the end of each year in December, 300,000 won must be deposited into the designated account of the subsidiary and 3) When the contract expires, the contract can be renewed under mutual agreement. She paid 300,000 won at the end of the year and hasn't written a contract since last year. The year changed to 2020, but there was no word to write a new contract. E (around December 20th) Jongjung's side was told to ``deposit 300,000 won'' via text message, and reported that the same amount of 300,000 won was deposited as ``implicit contract renewal.'' (The text message from the jongjung side is also saved, and the account is saved. There is also a deposit record) But the contents of the registered mail received by the father-in-law in February 21 (this year) is shocking. Three times the amount of 100 pyeong specified in the contract ended at the end of 19... 3 It is said that the land of 00 pyeong is in use, and three times the amount of land that was actually used was marked with a red line on the Naver map, and was enclosed and sent together. It is stated that it was occupied and used. In addition, it was stated that the annual tax of the land to be used this year was calculated with the'publicized land price' and the legal rent (5%), and the amount was about 10 million won, which is more than 30 times the 300,000 won. ㅠ.ㅠ This is a question>Q1. Is it correct that the implied contract renewal is three years old? (The previous contract was for a period of 3 years, and there is a text message stored by the servants who asked them to send 300,000 won in December of last year. Asking to pay the same age is evidence that the subsidiary also acknowledged that the contract was renewed, isn't it? ?) If yes, don't worry about the registered mail sent by the servant, and I wonder if I can live without renewing the contract for one more year... under the same conditions (300,000 won per year). Q2. You cannot raise your rent more than a few percent per year. Are there any legal provisions such as? �I think I was going to be a wife... But to pay 300,000 won per year, then 10 million won... It's a ridiculous impression. Q3. If you give up everything... and you don't want to sign a contract... Doesn't the house owned by the father-in-law receive any compensation? For reference, I did the roof construction for 20 million won two years ago (no proof data ㅠㅠ), and it's an old house as a whole, so it's shabby ㅠ.ㅠQ4. In any case, because the land is in its original condition and it is in a situation where the artisan adult pays the cost of the building demolition... I, the son-in-law... ) If you advise me to visit us... I will contact you immediately, and if you give me your contact information... I will pay a small consultation fee and call you.

When I asked if it was necessary to write a contract, I said that it was not necessary because it was handed over to the real estate that I had written. And the building owner contacted me on December 14, 20, and the renewal period passed, so this time it will pass, but the next renewal contract. He said that he would charge an administration fee from the time, and after a while since the contract was in February, he said he would charge an administration fee from February. When the first call was made, he said that it was not February 21, but February 22, and there was a mistake. The text message was finished, and a few days ago, I received a call saying that I did not pay the maintenance fee on the day of the monthly rent payment. I thought it was the end of the story, but when I asked why it was so, he said that he would look at the contract and talk about it. And when he contacted me, there was no contract for less than a year, and he told me to go to the real estate and rewrite the contract. He said that the monthly renewal period is correct.

I told you to pay the 20,000 won adjustment as it is, and then install the meter for the building separately, so I can't.

"Insist on inter-floor noise, Hakoji of the lower house","A couple of years ago, a couple and two boys moved to the lower house where my parents and high school student brother lived for about 18 years. (Approximately 3 years ago) I have been living for 7 years since I was 20 years old, so only my parents and my younger brother, who was a middle school student at the time, lived in my family. When I go to school, I lie down, and when my father and mother come home from work, I lie down. On weekends, two parents go camping and play, so they don't stay home, and my younger brother draws pictures, sits down, plays computer games, or lies down. There are many times when I skip rice too. It doesn't seem like a house where people live. The house itself is a house that sleeps a lot, so I like to sleep. Once my mother came home from work and ran the vacuum cleaner (less than 6pm), and the husband of the house underneath He came up and asked what to do if I run the vacuum cleaner at this time. My father wasn't at home, and my surprised mother asked me when I should run the vacuum cleaner. Still, I just said to be quiet and went down. After that, my mother was afraid of the vacuum cleaner, so I couldn't. Turning around while noticing that you're going to turn it (about once a week) (You turn it once a month. Or clean it with a broom...) You buy thicker slippers and wear them. (You originally wore slippers at home.) I couldn't write down all of them, but I really did my best for the noise of everyday life, such as making socks on the table and chairs and putting them on. Another time, I stopped by saying that my aunt is taking a refrigerator that I don't use at home, but he came after me. At that time, my father was at home and told me to measure the indoor noise and report it. After that, it did not come up, but there was something like water with a strange smell at the door of the house, and gum was stuck, and he was harassed for nearly a year.

When I stopped by the main house, everyone was sitting, but I was upset by the sound of thumping about what I was hitting from underneath (I haven't even tried this, I've been hitting it several times a day since I moved in) and tried to go down. I put up with it when I came up saying that I ran the vacuum cleaner, but I'm really angry to see what I did today. After checking the cctv, my father told me to go clean and apologize. My mother stopped me from telling me to apologize, and my mother is amazed.

Objection over frequent house repairs in LH rental housing,"I am currently living on the first floor of a rental house owned by LH. The production site has been a little over 10 years, and shortly after I moved in, I built several times on the living room side due to leaks from the underground household, and the clean house quickly became a dedication house. For 10 years, I had to do small constructions with leaking towels from underground households every year in winter, and most of them included the entire living room and kitchen where the boiler was located or the gas stove was located, the toilet, and pipes passed through. Likewise, about half of the living room and kitchen has been under construction. From last December until now, this winter only, three times during the winter, constantly cleaning up the housekeepers and repeating the removal after the construction is over, taking responsibility for the inconvenience of the lower generation, but on earth. I had to come and do the work that had to be done three times, and I had to go through the work to make the house a lot. The floorboards are already rags, and this work has caused a catastrophe that has to change the floorboards. I know I have to deal with it because I live in an old house, but I don't know how long I have to repeat this shoveling. Whenever this happens, I have a new repair team. It's a company that doesn't know where to leak water, even though it's a small corner of the house, whether he wants to open the door and threatens to open the door, saying that he needs to see the structure of the house. If I had the intention of doing it right from the beginning, I would like to protest a repair company that makes the construction work that could have been completed three times at a time, and a place where sanctions can be made against LH using such a company.

Since it was unfinanced, there are no senior bonds ahead of me, but can there be cases where the entire deposit cannot be recovered when entering the auction? 3.

Condensation Leakage Leakage Reoccurring after the second construction of a private house.

I have built a house on my father's land and have lived there for more than 30 years.,"Hello, this time I sold my father's land. There are some people who have built houses on our land for more than 30 years. I naturally lived in the place where my deceased father lived. He's a grandfather and grandmother. After several decades of not receiving the city tax or things properly, he has been receiving the city tax of 100,000 won a year from 7-8 years ago, and has been receiving about 300,000 won a year until the last 2-3 years. But this time, when it was time to sell the land, I arranged the house and asked for a move and said that I would pay a small amount of moving expenses. We let them live without receiving the city tax from them properly, and after remodeling the house where we live at will, we only told him that later. It is a house with asbestos and a slate roof, so it costs quite a bit for the demolition and report it. It's also our position.. I think it's too much because I'm asking for 13 million won right now. Is this cost really appropriate? Also, when I removed the building ledger, I was embarrassed because the owner came out separately. As for the area they use, the name of the deceased grandfather is listed as the owner, and on the other side, it is owned by the father, including the number of floor spaces as much as their buildings in the building ledger.

Please help with the dispute over the demolition of the mall.,"Good morning. I went to the real estate to open a restaurant. I found the family I wanted according to the conditions, showed the building owner and the property, and because it was less demolished, I asked the building owner if it would be demolished when I entered the store, but I said I knew it. I went with the people who were doing it, and even then, there was a ventilation facility in the household, except for that, and I did a demolition and said I understand. At that time, the landlord said that there was a demolition problem with the tenant in front, so I couldn't sign a contract right now and it would be owned for about 10 days. At the time, I was on a business trip to the province, so I was on the way up, and the real estate was demolished, and I went to the real estate to get the key and entered the building because I had to come to the real estate and sign a contract right away. He called and was waiting for the real estate to find out and give him a phone call, and the landlord came, and the tenant in front received the right money and took over, and he said he couldn't speak because he was sorry for the restoration to the original state because it was not working well. So I said that it's still not this, but when I asked if I knew how much it would cost, I said, ""I don't have the right money and the monthly rent is not cheap."" Thinking about it, I contacted the real estate and asked if there were any such cases, and I would rather do the demolition, so I asked for a tax. It's natural to do it, and if I can't say it because I'm sorry, the new boss asked what kind of crime he was doing, and he said he didn't know. The cost is too high, and I found out that there is a benefit of free removal for small business owners who closed the corona business and said that, but in fact, Before that, the tenant ran the business without paying a business, so it was said that the demolition benefits would not be available. So I told the real estate again, and the real estate didn't communicate with the landlord, and the owner said that it was cleaning, not demolition, and I told the real estate. When I asked if I did it because of this, he said that it was a joint broadcast, and that it was a situation that I delivered it because I did it at real estate b.

Apartment fire hydrant leak and upper boiler leak,"I am a renter of a house... Around January 13th, 2021, a leak occurred from the ceiling of the house...The ceiling swelled up and gradually changed into water droplets, and the water that had accumulated in the whole living room, kitchen, and small room bursts and continues to flow from the ceiling. Until January 23rd, I couldn't sleep well, I couldn't work, and I had to empty the water every 30 minutes. After talking a little bit, the ceiling of my house just said something like that, and I called a person in charge of the facilities of the management office through the security guard to show them the condition of the house and ask them to catch water leaks quickly. The floor we live in is 203, so it seems like a leak in the upper house, so when we went up to 303, there wasn't really anything to be a noose. So when I opened the water meter, it was fine. My house told me that water is not leaking, so I turned off all the valves for the water pipes of No. 303, No. 304, No. 404. The next day, it took two days to build the 404, and the water was still leaking. It was too frustrating, the water had to be emptied, and I couldn't go to work. I called the landlord of the 304 house and dug the same ground, saying that I had to do the work on the 304 as well. Even though it was caught, there was still a leak in my house. The landlord was still looking at the construction all day, not doing anything cancer, but he didn't solve it, so I and my wife and my three brothers kept looking for leaks while I was looking for a fire hydrant next to the door of No. 303. The water flowed from the entrance of Room 303, and the water came out to the front door of Room 303, so I informed Room 303 to see the boiler room. So I told you brightly that I'd have to tell you when a new construction worker comes in the morning, but you didn't listen to me and there was no water in room 303. He said that you should fix it with money. So I talked to the manager of the management facility and asked him to take action quickly, but after not doing it for a week... the water was leaking and they couldn't handle it, so I called the director, but he didn't know that it had been leaked from the 13th. On the 23rd, it wasn't possible for both the equipment manager and the construction worker to solve it, so I reported it to the manager. So, first, construction of 404. 304. It took 5-6 days after it was finished, and then he worked on the fire hydrant pipe....I don't know what the hell he did for a week, so I contacted myself and went to find it, and the smell of rancidness at home was everywhere. After all...I can't go to work or sleep...I talked to the director about this compensation problem because it was in this state, and I told them to write down all the things that would be compensated as much as possible because they had to have a meeting with each other, so we still compensate for mental damage to a minimum. .17 months old baby's hospital expenses, food expenses, I didn't ask for that... I was a taxi driver, and I couldn't work for 11 days, so I couldn't pay 2.11 million. It burst from the top of the refrigerator and asked for a total of 4.64,000 won for the middle and high price of the refrigerator, 1,300,000 won for the refrigerator, 280,000 won for a baby stroller (stored after one use), 50,000 won for a blanket, towels, shoes, two sets of padding, a milk pot, coffee machine, and transportation costs. After meeting with each other, they said they could only compensate for 1 million won, so they said why they couldn't. The boss said that his apartment itself doesn't have insurance. So he asked for a cut? That's why we didn't ask for mental damage compensation, nor did we ask for baby hospital fees, nor did we ask for food expenses. People who haven't come to my house don't know why they decide on their own, and then a few days later, I said again, and they came to a house where the smell was gone and the water was all dry? It would be hard to come after January 26th. So, how about doing the construction of the paperboard ceiling among themselves, and there is nothing in the compensation problem. If we do that, we implicitly agreed. How do we get compensation in the compensation problem after that? Then, because he didn't even say a mare, he said he didn't tell him to go out. Five minutes later, the director got a phone call and the representatives came, so listen to the story. So I went with my younger brother and listened to it while recording... This is because of a natural disaster, and they are wrong. There's no one... The bottom line is that you just use the refrigerator. It's okay. When they see it... It's ridiculous and there's nothing to listen to on the spot. This is 2.4 million won. What should we do?

I don't know if I'm going to go live...it's frustrating...I want to get up to 2.8~3.5 million won even if I can't go from 4.6 million won in terms of temporary housing or compensation issues...is there any way...

I would like to ask you about the noise between floors.,"I am living on the 3rd floor of a residential villa building from the 2nd to 5th floors except the rooftop. From 2 months ago, I could hear the thumping sound constantly from 10 a.m. to dawn, so I think I'm going crazy. Today it's too loud, I opened the window and screamed, so it became a little quiet, but after less than 30 minutes, it thumped again. When I screamed while striking, I rather thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump as if retaliating... I'm really crazy. I spoke to the Kakao Talk Room, a group of residents of the building, and all the people of the same Ho-line listened to them as well. We came out this way, and we were also victims, so we couldn't be specific. I was so angry that I went upstairs to talk to them, but they also wore indoor shoes and seemed to be gentle people. They're victims, too, and they're suffering the same pain as me. But one strange thing is, when talking to a group katok room, the 5th floor person living on the highest floor is not the sound of someone jumping rope on the roof. He tried to go over and said he was also a victim, such as hearing someone thump from above, but I'm curious about two things: Can the thumping sound from the floor noise come from the next door or from the lower house? I think that they only come down from the house above, but they all say they are not, so I can't specify who does it. They are also suffering. I think I can hear the thumping in another lake. In this way, we only dodge. Second, can the thumping of jumping rope on the roof of the building come down to the lower house or even the third floor? I think it's really ridiculous in my personal opinion, so I'm most likely suspicious of the fifth floor. Most of all, if you follow the thumping sound, the sound of the toilet bowl goes down with a fan, so I think the people upstairs are the culprit, but they both say they aren't, so it's frustrating. My parents just told me to bear with me because I'm so stressed out. Originally, you only say that you live like that, but I am in a situation where I hear even the sound of a thumping intentionally apart from the noise of life, so I would like to raise a complaint by specifying the culprit anyway, but please answer whether the two things I thought are correct or wrong.",administration

Real estate lease-related law question due to the reconstruction of the building.,"There is a building, and the building is torn down due to deterioration and is going to be rebuilt.

The contract expires by June 30 this year, Two months ago after it started, I asked him to leave the house by the end of March with proof of contents. However, the tenant asks for 10 million won in the right money while verifying the contents of the tenant. The contract says that the right money is not recognized.

Seoul Gwanak) Multi-family building market price and 1 financial sector mortgage,"Good morning! I am going to proceed with world medicine this Wednesday, but I have some questions that cannot be resolved, so I am posting this: 1) The building to be contracted is a building with a land area of ​​about 38 pyeong (?), and it is a new building built in 18 years. It is a building with 9 households living up to the 4th floor above the ground. There are some root mortgages, and the seniority amount is a little big, so I was worried, but when I was looking for a room, it was calculated using the market price provided by the two real estates I looked around, so it was safe to have a root mortgage + an existing seniority. I wanted to know the market price of the land and building on the Internet, so I searched it, but since it is a new construction, there is no market price, and the land purchase cost at the time of the building was about 400 million (3 types of residential land). Tells us about x 4 to x 5 times the cost of purchasing the land. Is the price quoted by the real estate correct? (Thinking in case it went to an auction... It is Sillim-dong, Seoul!) 2) About 300 million won (300 million won) for one financial sector in the relevant building. In general, one financial sector has a root mortgage based on a certain basis and standard. Do you set it up? Is it true that it is roughly 30% of the building price? There is no way to check the priority, and it is the first time in the world, so please leave an inquiry if you are curious! Thank you.",contract

I was aimed at the building owner,"I am a tenant who has been working in Yeongtong for 4 years. Not long after I moved in (1 year and 6 months later), the building was put on auction and I was nervous, but it seemed to go well. Someone is working to buy the land attached to the front and back of our building, but we should buy it first. There is no problem with our building. Shouldn't someone else buy the land in front of our building and put up the building? Even if <<I don't have money>, the probability of expanding the building is less than 2%, but I can't let go of it, so I know that the legal attorney asks you to get this document. Don't worry and sign it. The building tenants said that they could do business in the same way, without any doubt (it said that it would be better if they expanded it, but that it couldn't be done) and signed without raising a problem. When they said that the building owners weren't at all, they signed the last time and bought the land. (After that, it wasn't approved in the passing provinces in the city.) 1) You only get the deposit or 2) If you don't like both. 3) There will be a new pre-sale. After that, measure the amount of tax and deposit you want to the new shopping mall owner and come in. After 8 months to 1 year, you can not compensate for anything at all for the facility cost and moving costs. However, the pre-sale price measured and demanded is too absurd (the total 3-story building price is 87-100 billion won, but the total pre-sale price only on the first floor is 10 billion won, which is really higher than the price of the surrounding station area). Even if a new tenant was obtained, this amount of sales would inevitably pay at least twice or three times the existing rent, so the existing tenants were told to go out on their own.After that, when I looked closely at the contract, there was no personal information and even a store without contract capital Was a sloppy contract that was carried out only by someone other than the person who stamped it.

Please help when moving out of the chartered studio.,"Good morning. This is a young man who was living in a studio near the university district. First, I lived around 2016, extended a few times, and then renewed my contract in early January 20. The extension is one year and I think I can go out in the summer for reasons. I even heard an answer asking me to go out during the vacation season. After that, in April, I said that I wanted to go out and said that I would give a deposit in August, and then I kept putting it off by a month and a month until the contract ends. When I was on the phone, I told him not to pay, so I didn't pay it, but I'm worried that I'll catch a pod when I move out. I pay only gas for the maintenance fee, and the rest are notified by adding the Internet, co-management fee, electricity, and water to the bill. Come to think of it, I don't even use the Internet, but I can't do it... Also, the window that passes through the veranda sash boiler is broken, should I ask for this too? If you look at gold, the part that was cut from the cut because of the fluctuation must have been cut off really thick and big, but it became like bread. If an ignorant person has conviction, it is impossible to win. I will meet such a master grandmother and talk to him and go crazy. Summarized ㅡ Received a fixed date _ Deferred even when the contract says that you will go out in the middle of ejaculation The eviction period has arrived ㅡ I recorded a call saying that I will not receive the maintenance fee, but is it effective ㅡ Is the sash broken?

The issue of noise between floors and renters,"I live alone on the 4th floor, and on the 3rd floor, I have 3 households on the 1.2th floor of my grandmother's home. I have now moved for about two months. I signed a two-year contract. I think it’s too sensitive. He came up at the sound of a chair pulling and knocked at the door and said it was noisy. He got a phone call even though he was talking with a friend at night, and even though he was going up the hallway, he opened the door and yelled at why he went up the stairs so loudly. My parents' phone number, etc. They screamed and pointed and said, “I'm not thumping, I'm not gaining a lot of weight, and I'm really lighter than normal, and I'm just walking up, so... I can't crawl... and no matter how much if I wear shoes. Even if I go up carefully, it makes noises, but some say that I walk in shoes and there is no sound if I wear sneakers.. Who doesn't know that.. There are days when I have to wear shoes. I was going up the stairs together to have dinner with 3 friends at home, but I didn't say a word and walked quietly. It's frosty and I close it without knowing, so break the door and come out with a beat!!! So I was so surprised that all my friends were scared and I was scared, but because the door was smashing, I heard all kinds of nagging and screamed whale whales. I was ejaculation and crooked, so I went down then... I'm not the first to try it, and this is the first time I've ever lived like this... According to the landlord, the person who lived before has lived for 5 years, but I don't understand how he lived here... Too much the landlord I think this is sensitive I'm going up my house, but I always carry a bracket and I can't open the bathroom door properly at home. I was wondering why they ordered delivery so much.. I opened the door from above and was waiting for the delivery man, so I heard a sound... Should I also pay attention to my delivery?? I'm so stressed that the landlord isn't going to serve you..Is this noisy and wrong?.?Weekdays, I'm working quietly and carrying the brackets by myself on weekdays, and my friends come to play occasionally... I think I'm just talking, and I send it back to the house before 11. Is this much of a friend calling too often? The landlord asks me to live quietly, but I couldn't bring a friend to my house, and I couldn't be comfortable talking on the phone. Going around, I have a lot of things to say, but I'm trying to stay quiet without saying anything, but the more I think about it, the more I get a fever. Is this normal? And in my house on the 4th floor, there is a sound of the automatic door opening on the 1st floor. Is this the soundproofing of the building itself? It's been only two months since I moved, so it's so stressful, depressed, and it's not fun to come home. Even if I only hear the sound of the landlord, I am amazed, avoiding, and hiding in order to massage...I feel like I've become a criminal, I feel like a woman, and I am timid, so I'm just wondering if I'm moving now, it's due.

The officetel management fee suddenly changed.,"I signed a reverse tax contract with a new officetel and first housed it in October of last year. At that time, the real estate management fee is about 100,000 won, and if you use the parking tower, 40,000 won will be added, and the management fee will be about 140,000 won per month. When I searched for the real estate of the officetel, the management fee was shown in that amount. On the day of the first move-in after signing a request contract, the person named the manager read the paper called the management agreement contract, read it, and signed it. When parking was not allowed, it was stated that it was 105,000 won after signing, and until October-December after that, the maintenance fee was about 16,000 won, including about 110,000 won for internet use, but the problem was the maintenance fee in January 21st. The tower agency fee is added 40,000 and more, and more than 300,000 won has been added to the management fee. Since it was a service period in the past, it was the service period, and now, the period is over, and I will charge the actual cost. Parking tower agency now has a lot of gold apps because the number of parking lots used by residents is less than the number of parking towers available. When you signed a house contract, when you first moved in and wrote a management agreement contract, there was no mention of requesting the service period or the actual cost of the maintenance afterwards. Is it correct to notify you suddenly? That is not an additional 10,000 won, but twice as much as it is imposed.

I asked if I would pay the same maintenance fee for other small houses. When I asked the real estate, they also told me that the landlord also paid the management fee of 110,000 won at the management office. They also said that 110,000 won was a base, and they didn't know if it would be additionally added. Does this make sense??? I know that there is no real estate responsibility.. I know that the management fee is usually set according to the size of the management fee, and the manager shows me the ledger managed by an Excel file on weekdays. Is written..

"Hello? I am a franchise owner who has been operating a CU convenience store in Bokjeong-dong, Sujeong-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do since January 2011, and closed its business on January 15, 2021. The convenience store I operated is a commercial housing building, and after the contract period with our headquarters was over, we decided to obtain a new franchisee in September 2020 to receive the rights we initially paid, and the process of takeover was in progress. Meanwhile, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floors of the building we were leased were defined as illegal buildings due to illegal remodeling, so cigarette retailers did not come out. Initially, it was not listed as an illegal building, so it was possible to obtain a cigarette retailer's license normally. In the same year, it was regulated as an illegal building in the building register. Therefore, we asked the building owner to dismantle the illegal building, but we did not accept it, but rather said that we were not responsible for it, and in the end, we took all the damage and closed the business with tears. I would like to know if there is a way to win a lawsuit in case of a lawsuit for claiming damages from business closing costs, operating damage costs and rights due to illegal buildings by the owner. Below is a brief summary of the situation in chronological order. 1. On January 14, 2011, we signed a lease agreement on the 1st floor of Bokjeong-dong, Sujeong-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do for the operation of the CU convenience store (CU Bokjeong Success Store). After that, the contract was renewed every two years, and the lease contract was concluded on January 14, 2021. 2. Convenience store operation was difficult, so we asked the CU head office for understanding and asked to find a new store owner to operate the CU double success store instead, and the CU head office found a new store owner and even negotiated a right amount of 30,000,000 won (September 2020). It is about mid-September.) This situation was also notified to the landlord at the time of mid-September, and the landlord also agreed to change the tenant. 3. As a result of reading the building ledger for the replacement of the store owner, CU headquarters found that it was listed as a “building violating”, which was not present at the time on January 14, 2011. The registration of “building violating” is as of May 20, 2011, after the initial lease contract. Has been confirmed. If it is listed as a ""violation building"", the cigarette retail certification certificate (right to sell cigarettes), which is the most important for the operation of a convenience store, is not issued, making it impossible to replace it with a new store owner. 4. Accordingly, I sent a proof of protest to the landlord and asked for compensation for the damage several times, but asked the CU head office and I to sue if they were going to sue, as it could not have been known whether or not the building was in violation. In addition, the landlord said that they were ""violating buildings"" due to illegal remodeling from the time they purchased the building (2004), and they do not know why they were listed on the building register in May 2011. 5. On January 14, 2021, we closed the store as planned, and we did not receive any compensation from the building owner, and it is a very difficult situation due to the damage caused by it.",,Trading

In this case, you can't ask for anything about the defects that can happen within 10 years, right? Is it correct to receive compensation for up to 10 years in advance with hundreds of thousands of won in damages? Since the defect compensation lawsuit is a defect compensation lawsuit for public and private use, we would have diagnosed defects. So, how did we diagnose defects for individual use? I haven't said anything because there are no visible defects, but it is judged that there are no defects in the use of my house, so in the future, can't I ask for compensation to the contractor in the event of an invisible defect? If the things I think are correct above, it would be better not to transfer the defect remuneration. How do you usually do it? This is my first time, so I don't know anything. Since the apartment is now 5 years old, the maximum removal period is 10 years (Is it right?) If you think about it, you have 5 years left.

Charge for repairing defects in the private house,"Hello, I am a tenant who has been living in a charter for a month ago. I would like to ask if I can claim a defect repair fee (cosmetic leak work/toilet pipe work). I didn't do paperwork, floor covering, film, entrance, washing room tile, and other aging toilet accessories) and also stated on the contract. Before starting the interior, I was looking at the house with a contractor and found that there was a water leak in the toilet. The leaky part of the toilet has a convex wall tile), but the grandfather of the landlord said that he had to tear it off and paint it, and the interior contractor said that it is not a problem at all. I told you to call a leak specialist for construction, but he said he couldn't take a dime of money. He said he couldn't do anything unless he paints himself. He refused until the end. He came separately and repaired it, and when the tiles were removed in the process, the wall was all black and moldy (it was a wooden wall..) The wall opposite the toilet wall, as well as the existing shoe cabinets fixed on the wall, were all black. The opposite wall was also sinking, not the shower, so it wasn't worse than the shower wall, but the wall on the other side of the kitchen wall was all moldy and rusted. I called the owner of the house with only the tiles open and showed him. If this is the case, he called an expert and said that the landlord should repair it.. The grandfather of the landlord came and looked at it and sighed completely. He went down to do the repairs on his own. The contractor knew that the landlord was an amazing person, so he carefully recorded all the pictures and videos, and this is not weird even if he sits down right away, so of course the landlord has to do and the problem that can be claimed when leaving. All of your legally necessary opinions and estimates were prepared and received. In addition, when I took out all the luggage of the former tenants, there were molds in places that were not visible (rooms), and we were working on all of these additionally while wallpapering them. I cooperate with all interiors other than the structural change in the contract) and after the contract is over, the wallpaper is silky wallpaper, so repair it when you go out. He doesn't say he'll go in and choose wallpaper and flooring, but the reinforced floor is good. Besides, the floor is going to come up in the middle of the process, and the vendors are going to roast and paint it, so make the first floor aisle as a service. Please, look at other toilets as a service....The reason for prolonging this story is that he never really wants to see his damage, who never spends a single penny of his money. The estimate for toilet leak work was about 270 and honestly making noise. I didn't like it, so I thought I would just go out if there was no problem until I left (when I got the deposit back), but one more toilet toilet was guided before the interior construction started. I talked to my grandfather, and I told you that this is the part where money goes in, so I told you that it wasn't possible. There were two toilets, so there was no big problem because I was using a different toilet. The customer came and told me to call a toilet contractor because I was talking about the toilet, but the toilet contractor also did not have a clogging problem, but it is a plumbing problem. When you said that it wasn't possible, the plumbing was so big that there was no problem with the plumbing. The contractors ran away because they were farming and asked what the hell would you do with them, so you do it yourself... The thirsty person digs a well. Face confiscation Never couldn't speak. We called a separate supplier today to remove the toilet and repair it. The cause was the piping design was wrong. Something was backflowing and the air was filled with gas. Anyway, it was a piping problem. I feel very stressful..I want to go out after the contract is over after 10 million won with the thought of living for 4 years. Documents are not available, I have only a transcript of the toilet that I can't do on my own.) Is there a toilet leak repair fee? Is there anything else that can be claimed in addition to whether it is possible to get a toilet repair fee? It was cheaper than the price quote, and it was said that he provided all the documentation (what was the problem, etc.) *The most important thing is whether it is possible to claim the deposit after receiving the deposit back (otherwise, he will never give the deposit deposit on time). He lifted the crane (he came up once an hour during the interior. The first floor of the owner's house, the second floor of the writer..) He says he will do whatever he needs.. I don't know what else is needed. Honestly, I am very worried when I go out later. Because I saw him crying (the building was unreasonable, he prevented him from putting up a ladder, he asked him to go after 50,000 won for each misprint that had existed before. It's legally nonsense, so I took out my luggage and looked at the house for two hours on the same day, and then I went with the bank.) If I knew he was such a landlord, I would never have signed a contract, but I would say anything before the contract. Thank you for reading the complaints",contract

I would like to ask a question about the renter's renter's burden for the construction cost of the jeonpa waterworks.,"I live in Sillim-dong, Seoul. I lived in an old villa as an LH youth jeonse lease, but when it was cold a few days, the toilet did not freeze for about two days. There is no other way to solve it because the toilet has a sink and washing machine, and there is no other way to solve it, so dissolve the lake connected to the toilet water filling part with a hairdryer, pour hot water several times, and replenish the water with the sink lake. I got off. Two days later, we went down well, so we thought there would be no problem, but we live in Room 201, but the 101 side said that the water was too leaking from the ceiling, so you came to visit about 3 days before construction. I only heard that my younger brother is a contractor and that the people who are doing the freeze construction came and went to work the next day. After that, my cousin had to go down to my hometown, so I was away for about a week, and the water on the 101 side was too strong, so I drained the hot water at all, so I could not wash it after work the day and the workers came early the next morning. I came early and packed my luggage and went to work as if I was chased. Then, it is the day after construction (today writing) whether you came to check the construction. Since the working hours are long, it is natural that I could not get my clothes and arrangements, and the house was cluttered, but it seems that I talked a lot to my cousin (contractor) over the phone from the cleaning nagging to the cost of freezing water supply construction.

I was originally thinking of extending it, and I was moving because of an unexpected job problem.I said that I was sorry to say the situation so late, but I should have said it three months ago, and I repeated the same words and got angry. .. Anyway, the landlord released my room in the real estate, and the talk ended that I would cooperate as much as possible. Then about a week later? I was in the room I signed for on Saturday, so I gave the password to me because I wasn't in the room I signed for. Then the next Sunday, I was in the room I signed for, and the bandit sounded off and the real estate + people who came to the room + the landlord came in I asked what to do if I came without contact like this, and said I was sorry, saying that I didn't know there was, and laughed and looked at the room. After that, I was smart and came to see the room without contacting 2 or 3 teams a day for the weekend and always opened the door. However, if I know in advance, I can wait and clean the room or even prepare my mind, so I told the landlord, ""I will cooperate unconditionally to show the room, but I want you to contact me before coming to see the room.""

"Hello, I am curious about the cost of managing the neighborhood living facilities and commercial buildings.","Hello, this is the president of Newbie. It is a small three-story building (with a building area of ​​636.3㎡), but the tenants of the shopping mall are only on the basement and the first floor. From the second floor, there are houses and churches, and recently there are various things in the shopping mall. The biggest issue is that there are many talks about the use of the parking lot in the shopping mall, and the management fee seems to have a lot of problems, so it is not managed by the tenants. He says that the person who manages the service is the focus, and in addition, he says he has a close relationship with many shopping owners and shows off his friendship. Of course, it's good, but from the perspective of tenants, the current Gyeonggi-do is difficult and he tells himself about it. It can't be done even if you do. There are also some avoidance of responsibility that you have to talk to the owners of the shopping mall, and some really ridiculous things are happening.. According to the person who manages, there is a separate owner of the parking lot. He said that he thought he was planning to flatten the floor with concrete and operate it as a paid parking lot (not all renters agreed, and the manager gave an opinion by reflecting only the area of ​​the renter who was close to him or herself). I may have arranged for you, and I tried to meet with a number of tenants and a manager about the problem of management fees and parking a while ago, and I tried to talk about it, but when I spoke to the manager orally, I was told to call it good, and after setting up a seat, I asked the manager. When I contacted them, I heard that the tenants and managers weren't going to do that in social life, saying that they couldn't call themselves with each other, asking the landlords for permission, etc. I didn't have time, so I was told that I wasn't doing that in social life. .The current account has been changed from the account of the brother of another lake to the account of the person who manages it, and there seems to be a lot of problems with billing for maintenance fees such as cleaning the bathroom. I want to listen to it.. Most of the toilets were dirty, and the toilet was dirty with someone else's stool for about a week. There are many people who go to the large church toilet next to me. A shopping mall with 10 won costs 150,000 won. Office work costs 9,000 won each. It's been about half a year since I rented it, and from the beginning, I was reluctant to see the management fee bill, but since we are not doing it, we have passed on with it. There is no detailed information about the preliminary cost.. Usually, the maintenance fee is charged for about 4~50,000 won per month. In the case of cleaning, the tenants rotate each other. The manager himself pays a million won per day and the business owners don't hesitate to say that you earn a month and you earn a month.. If you earn a million won a month, do you do business?. I don't really understand why you're doing that haha.. Especially in such a situation. Decent bragging;; Yesterday, you parked in our parking lot and repaired the next shopping mall. You didn't clean it either. ㅋㅋ, etc. It is a stupid operation. -------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------//I talked a lot with the renter, and this is the answer from the landlord. .Management fee is the same as the owner. The lessor is the money paid by the tenant except for the repair of basic facilities for the building, so it is normal to receive guidance or information that the correct calculation receipt was used. It is not correct to not park in the parking lot and use a paid parking lot. The landlord is the land of all 13 people. Even if there is a lot of stake, I think it is a matter of demolition and reconstruction. If a tenant without a manager does it, it is very difficult? It is the right of the tenant for a week or a month. I asked the boss to disapprove if Ho couldn't park. I'm worried that I'll add an administrative fee for installing and managing.

It was frantic to stop lifting the gym (I decided to use the rooftop at the time of the contract) The boiler broke after a month of moving, so it was frantic that we had to pay 200,000 won for repairs. It was ridiculous to ask for 15,000 won a month, but I was paying it. I saw the company cleaning it a few times. However, at some point, the company was not visible, and the housekeeper did not pay the cleaning fee for several months in the middle, so I was not forced to clean it, but after the landlord entered the building, I was forced to pay the cleaning fee again. I was just giving it (building utility manager), but when I checked with the cleaning company today, they only cleaned until November 2019. From June 2022 until now, I kept paying the cleaning fee, but it turned out that the landlord received the same cleaning fee as before without saying anything to the tenants. It seems that I cleaned it by myself. Last month, I was told to pay 200,000 won for each household, and they said that they cleaned it with the reverse flow of the septic tank. I'm moving, but...

Landlord's Unfair Rent Request,"Lease means that the lessor has the debt and the right to claim the rent to make the lessee use the real estate, and the lessor has the obligation to pay the rent and the right to profit from the use of the real estate.

After receiving a loan from a financial institution in the local housing business, approval of the business plan (application for approval of the business plan has already been completed) is scheduled. At the same time, financial institutions are planning to set up a mortgage right for the site. According to each subparagraph of the relevant law, the act of setting a mortgage right, such as a mortgage right, is prohibited on the site... There is confusion. The conclusion is that even after the application for approval of the regional housing association's business plan, if there is no prospective tenant, is there no room for the above provisions? Accordingly, is it safe to set a mortgage right on the site to the main jurisdiction? We seek the opinions of experts.",law

I would like to do a better solution than cancel the contract, so please advise me on how to do it. For reference, I signed a contract after checking an empty house as a plan to enter the interior before moving in, but because of the defect, the interior estimate was higher than expected. The due diligence schedule for litigation related households overlaps with the scheduled construction schedule, so if the interior work is done according to the plan, the defect cannot be checked during the due diligence, but even if it wins later, the generational compensation is not received.

Questions on the practice of collecting donations,"Good morning? I have a question about the “donation and payment practice”, so I was looking for knowledge IN. 1.

Also, I would like to ask you how to distinguish it from impermanence, which is used in practice. 3. In practice, I would like to ask about the object of the donation. In general, it is known that the target of donations is the land where the infrastructure is installed, which is in kind, but when I looked for related articles, it was confirmed that the donations can be collected in cash. In practice, I would like to ask what exactly is the object of the donation. In addition, I would like to inquire about the legal basis, such as laws, enforcement decrees, rules, guidelines, etc. governing the objects to be collected. 4. I would like to ask about the detailed procedure for collecting donations in practice. It is understood that the collection of donations is usually concluded in the form of an agreement or contract through consultation with the administrative office. I would like to know exactly the procedure from the consultation process, which is a preliminary procedure, to the time when the donation is completed. I would also like to ask about the legal basis governing the donation collection procedure. 5. I would like to ask about the problems of the donation payment system in practice. I would like to know in detail what is the main problem in practice related to the collection of donations at the front line, and if there is a problem, what is the problem. 6. I would like to ask if there are any materials (main practice offices; litigation data, etc.) that can be referenced in order to acquire a broad knowledge of donations and payments, and where to get them.

"During the expansion of the apartment veranda, I accidentally removed the veranda sash bearing wall. Please advise","During the expansion of the living room and small room veranda, the bearing walls were removed. Prior to that, I called the apartment management office and asked for a notification of the expansion and whether the sash wing wall could be removed, and there were some houses that had been demolished. The interior president said it was difficult to do it, so we proceeded with the permit through an agency instead. And on the day of the construction estimate, we asked the management office to see if it could be demolished again. You pointed to another wall and explained that it is a wall that should not be hit, and did you get permission for construction with the front omitted? Yes, we got permission and replied. Because the owners were not each other, it seems that the management office talked about the bearing wall, and it seems that we were talking about the expansion work. And that evening I went back to the management office and asked if it was really okay to remove it. I got permission once again that the wing wall does not contain steel frames, and that it is not a wall that supports structurally, but that it is okay to support the sash. But because I got permission, I didn't think it was a big problem. On the same afternoon, while another interior boss was invited to make an estimate for a paper sheet, the boss said, ""This is a wall that should not be demolished."" I learned that the wing wall we built is a strength-bearing wall and a wall that should not be demolished. I thought that it was legal, not that we were intentionally trying to do it for convenience, but since we learned that it was illegal, the pain of my heart is so great. In many places, it's okay if I don't report it, so I just told them to live, but I don't want to do it illegally at all, so I'm asking for advice. The next day we contacted the management office again, and you see it as our construction permit and said that it is possible to remove the wing wall with this permit, He came and looked at it and said,'Oh, this shouldn't be done, but it doesn't seem to be largely supported, and there aren't many steel frames, so you can just buy it without worrying.'

[Consultation on property rights infringement by “building ships” in Article 46 ②. of the Building Act],"As I live, I cannot forbid unfairness about ""Article 46 of the Building Law"", so I want to know in depth about this law. [Question 01] Article 46 of the Building Law below ①. ②. are all laws designed to secure ""roads"" under the Building Act? Does it mean that the permit holder can designate the construction line at will for roads longer than 4m? [Question 02] Even if there are construction lines that are land and road boundary lines in urban roads of 20m or more, at the discretion of the license holder, there is no business plan, that is, in the state that there is no district unit plan or street maintenance project plan, local districts It is true that “Article 46 ② of the Building Act” is interpreted and applied as a meaning that it is possible to designate a new building line by retreating the existing road boundary line by 3m for the purpose of solely without designation + only for the convenience and openness of pedestrians. Is it reasonable? If ""Article 46 ②."" of the Building Act really means that, is it an extended ""road"" facing a 20m road with an area 3m retreating from the road boundary, secured for public use? It is necessary for the decision of the license holder and for the public purpose, and it is a land secured for the purpose of the convenience of pedestrians and a sense of openness. Also, in my view, the traffic volume and density of people are quiet on the sidewalk of the 20m road facing the building. And there is only one building that violates the designated building line based on the ""Building Law Article 46 ②."" from the train station to the end of the building line. = In other words, from the perspective of the residents From a perspective, it is in a state of complete complete with street maintenance, arrangement of buildings, and a sense of openness. (Therefore, there is no regional district designation, district unit plan, street maintenance plan, or any business plan, and pedestrians are inconvenient to pass. It is said that there have been no complaints in 52 years.) But the local government says that there is no compensation of 1 won after cutting off more than 30 pyeong of 80 pyeong of individual's private property. Is not a road"" or ""just notice"", but the ""open and front notice"" is not secured as a ""building limit line"" rather than a building line, so they say that they are ""architectural ships"" in accordance with ""Article 46 ② of the Building Act."" As a basis, it is said that “the public notice is secured without compensation.” All of the “Building Law Article 46” in that matter is a law for securing “roads” under the Building Law, but it seems not a law created with the aim of securing “front notice”. It seems that local governments are using this Act for convenience and for the purpose of avoiding compensation. [Question 03] Notwithstanding the “~ Paragraph 1” stipulated in Article 46②. of the Building Act, separate construction ships are designated within the scope prescribed by Presidential Decree. The provision of ""can be allowed"" does not specify the time limit or limit of the number of times, so the license holder grants the power to infringe the ""private land"" indefinitely without compensation by designating the building line on any roadside forever and infinitely. [Question 04] Is this Article 46 ② of the Building Act a law that stipulates that the compensation for loss of private property is omitted? [Question 05] This is not the Article 46 ② of the Building Code. Isn't there any element that directly violates the “Property Guarantee Article 23 of the Constitution ③”? Article 23 ① of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea The property rights of all citizens are guaranteed. ② The exercise of property rights shall be appropriate for public welfare. ③ Acceptance, use, or restriction of property rights due to public need and compensation for such property shall be provided by law, but fair compensation shall be paid.

Since it is in the state of automatic extension, the contract is in the 22nd year...>?? (Right??In 2022 ...?) I'm working on August 4th, 2020, but I got a call from the landlord. As I'm shifting, it's often changed day and night, and it's dull. I cleaned the kimchi container in the bathroom at dawn on the day off. It must have been noisy. It seems like it's a living room or a living room. (Our house is the owner's household) Then he asked if he had pets and if he got permission to break through the inner barrier when installing the air conditioner (air conditioner is 2in1).I never allowed it, so he asked me to repair the wall and put it in the real estate tomorrow. I was screaming to go out...I got a phone call at night and got so angry, I just talked to myself and couldn't make a phone call at dawn, so I sent a story about raising a pet dog with Kakao Talk. I thought that you could understand a little bit because I was raising my children, and I brought them with pity, and they were kids who had no place to go... and that I was unaware of the inter-floor noise (two months ago as the third floor was bought this time? ...) The living room mat was ordered, and after 9 o'clock, he moved in in 2016 and said that he would be careful not to use home appliances. I said that if the air conditioner installation wall in the home room was pierced incorrectly, the building could be octoped. Because of the hole in the wall of my house, the corridor tiles were protruding forward, and the construction was done several times. He said that the building builder did not understand ... How much money did it cost? When I first came, I said that I did it with permission. When I first came, I said that it was because of the air conditioner installation, and when I heard that I knew that the door was opened from the real estate, I didn't allow it. Then, I asked the real estate to take care of the solution. ....;Before I leave, I will claim compensation for damages, so he pretends to be prepared.And before leaving that I have a dog and a cat, I call xscom to disinfect and disinfect the wallpaper, claim a receipt, and leave the wall, of course, to restore it to its original state. Then, when I asked how much time I could give me, I also cleaned the house, organized my luggage, and said that I needed some time. So the landlord said that I could do it in February about spring. Why did I put it out at the door to dispose of the trash after that? If you live with your house as a garbage I got stressed out... a few contacts came and tightened me up, and in 2021, I got a call to put a house on the real estate. So I contacted the real estate I had contracted for the first time and talked about the self-help class. And the person who opened the rooftop said that he was already going to another place, and there was no one who worked at the time, so the real estate says I don't know ... And because I came to see the house from the real estate yesterday, I finished the night shift and the dog After returning, I got a call from the landlord, but I couldn't answer the phone because I was driving. Will you go ...;;; When I was notified unilaterally like this, I didn't know if it was right to remove it without saying anything, so I told my prospective husband who delayed marriage due to corona and gave him the landlord number. I was absent and there were dozens of them.. I got a call from the person who went to the real estate and the house. ......If you talk to me, I think you will treat each other so emotionally, so I gave you the number to talk to my boyfriend. Last year, when I turned the washing machine on a cold day, the downstairs was frozen and the plumbing was fixed. If something like this happens next, I told them to pay for it, and who saw me throw away the wooden bed frame on the rooftop? He said that all the tiles on the exterior wall of the building are protruding from the front because of that, and,,,, so what do you want me to do? But when I contact you again, I will talk about the cost of repairing the exterior wall tiles again later. I don't have any consultations with us. I signed a contract with the person who came to see the house on February 24th and asked us to go inside that time ;;; At the same time, raising a dog is a violation of the contract, so he told us to pay for the welfare. ..But I don't know why I'm doing this now, and I'll pay you the rest of the rent if I come home on the day of picking, and if you like it.-0 -It seems like an old couple lived before, but I don't know how they handled it well, but it's like this one or two times. It seems like it is habitual to pay off the deposit and give it to the renter's requirement..It is a violation of the contract to raise a companion animal, so if the landlord asks you to leave, you have to leave. I will ask for damages for the protruding exterior wall tiles due to the problem of opening the inner wall. Now that I have a pet, I call a cleaning company for the next new move in, sterilize it, and submit a receipt to the landlord. And since it was said that the new recruits will arrive by the 24th, pull out the luggage before that. After taking care of all the above ....

I didn't see the right thing. And in order to claim damages, we need to have clear evidence that it is because of our house, right?

The aunt living in a state-owned land also said that our land is like a haunted house, so please repair it or build it and come in.

"There are illegal buildings on my ground, and the administrative office (gu office) has been neglecting them for 18 years, so the damage is severe. What should I do?","Good morning. I am the owner of the land where illegal buildings are located. I became the owner by receiving a successful bid through an auction conducted in 2019 by the administrative agency to recover the compulsory implementation of illegal buildings. There is an illegal building of about 796.63㎡ on my land. This illegal building was newly built by sharing one wall of the existing building (about 511.08㎡), so it looks like a single building, but the existing building was in 1999, and the illegal building was in 2003. Since the building was built at different times in the year and maintains the independence of the building, it is recognized as an independent building by the administrative agency. Therefore, the illegal building was excluded from the public sale appraisal as an unregistered building. The problem is that the administrative agency only imposes a total of 2.6 billion won from 2003 to 2020 for corporate judicial corporations such as empty shells that have no property, and never pay the compulsory performance money. In accordance with the relevant laws, I am not suing or executing administrative proxy in accordance with the relevant laws. I first filed a complaint with the administrative agency requesting the execution of administrative proxy in accordance with the following requirements of the Administrative Proxy Execution Act, but ① there must be non-compliance of obligations under public law The default obligation is a substitute duty, ③ It is recognized that neglect of the failure severely harms the public interest, and ④ There is no other method to be executed. I replied to my complaint with an answer saying that it does not meet the requirements of administrative agency execution because it cannot be considered seriously harming the public interests of the general public. (In fact, it seems that the real reason is that the administrative agency has never performed administrative agency and the telephone answer that it does not perform administrative agency because it is an illegal building on a private property.) It is a situation that can be strongly asserted because it exactly matches the case that was recognized as harming the public interest (the Supreme Court sentenced on Dec. 12, 1995, sentenced 95nu10907). ※ Supreme Court sentenced on Dec. 12, 1995, sentence 95 Nu 10907 Summary: It cannot be said that the proportion of illegal extensions in buildings occupied by no means, and if such illegal buildings are neglected, the authority of the authorities to crack down on illegal buildings will be incapacitated. There is a concern that the smooth performance of the administration will be jeopardized, and the greater public interest of preventing the avoidance of the restrictions prescribed by the Building Act at the time of permits and completion inspections under the law is feared. ...And although I tried to request the interpretation of the vote from other high-ranking institutions, the answer that it is not an issue to be interpreted was returned because the standard for judging the public interest lies with the competent administrative office (gu office). What I would like to ask here is, as above, Since the competent administrative office (gu office) is imposing only the performance compulsory fee on ineffective violators, there is no expectation of improvement, and the administrative office does not take any measures (complaints and administrative proxy executions).

The industrial complex is being auctioned by a trust, and the city planning road (industrial complex access) in Gyeongju City has not been completed. The deposit received for land compensation has also been confiscated, and road facilities cannot be acquired due to non-payment of construction costs for road construction.

I would like to ask about rental inquiries. (Illegal buildings),"Good morning. I am so desperate for help, so I am writing like this. Around June 2020, I rented about 24 pyeong of the first floor of a prefabricated panel building and started business. Using it without any problems The problem happened around November 2020. One day, I came to the branch office permit section and received a report of an illegal building, and took pictures here and there. Of course, at the time of the contract, I did not hear any notice about such illegal buildings. After receiving the report, I found out. Illegal Building = 1. There was a randomly made double-story building on the first floor, and it is an illegal building, and the staircase going up to the second floor is also a problem. (These were the original structures at the time of the contract, and there were also stairs, but the slope was so severe that when interior, the stairs only cost about 2.5 million won to reduce the slope and reinforce it.)2. The entrance to the shopping mall (existing car center) protrudes 1m in front of the blueprint, so this is also called an illegal building. What I worked on was the opening type of the existing shutter method, and I attached the folding door by keeping the shutter position intact. The government office said that there was nothing that could make me illegal. I said it didn't matter because all of the existing ones were reinforced for business. The problem is benign? It is said that if you work, you can use it as it is, but the training cost was very expensive. They tell me to pay the cost. (It's my fault that was reported) He said the building owner pays the fine. I keep saying that I can't pay, and the current monthly rent is also over 4 months. Of course, it is a situation where normal sales are not possible. I'm curious here: 1. I didn't notify the illegal building at the time of the contract. Isn't that the reason for the breach of the contract? 2. If the contract is violated (the building owner), I can't do business there anymore. What should I do with the interior cost or the like? 3. The building owner (A) is separated. The landlord and the person (B) who rented the entire land and building are connected. I did medicine around the world with a person who rented a whole house. When I asked around, it was called a jeonse contract. I'm curious what kind of problem this is. 4. (B), who made a deal with me, is in a situation where the monthly rent has been delayed for several months, so it is a weak point that it is a breach of the contract, and it is a situation that is not shy. I'm so upset and these days I go to a psychiatrist and even take panic disorder medicine. It's a difficult-to-open store with money from relatives, but everything seems to be blown away in a moment. The stairs on the 2nd floor have been destroyed, and the railings on the 2nd floor are completely blocked. Anyway, it was an act to continue the business. I also worked on the second floor at my own expense. How should I do it? Please someone help.",contract
